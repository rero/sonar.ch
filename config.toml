The Swiss Open Access Repository is an **archive of scholarly publications**. It collects and promotes **open access publications by authors affiliated with Swiss public research institutions**. It does so by aggregating content and metadata from international sources as well as from institutional repositories (IR) of Swiss Higher Education Institutions (HEI).

SONAR also proposes a subscription-based **"[IR hosting service](/iraas/)"** for interested HEIs, thereby acting as their primary research showcase and allowing their authors to directly deposit their publications.

SONAR contributes to the [Swiss national Open Access strategy](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/fr/themes/digitalisation/open-access-campagne/strategie-nationale-et-plan-daction) and its action plan, led by [swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch).
