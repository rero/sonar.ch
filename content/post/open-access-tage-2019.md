Two members of the SONAR team attended the Open Access Tage 2019, earlier this month in Hannover, to present the project. The conference is the main annual meeting of colleagues working in the field of Open Access in the German-speaking world. The aim of the presentation was to introduce SONAR into this context.

During the talk and the conference as well it became apparent, that the different countries travel in different speeds and on different, but similar roads towards an OA-future, with Germany far ahead. One task of SONAR will be to built and maintain contacts with projects and infrastructures in other countries, learn from their experiences, while upholding a Swiss perspective that fits into the structures of Swiss academic life.
